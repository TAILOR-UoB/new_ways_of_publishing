# Glossary

Glossary of common terms used in the new ways of publishing.

```{glossary}

Host
  Machine or service that is hosting the online published material.

Client
  The final user's device that is requesting the website to the server. This is
  most commonly a web browser in a computer, phone or tablet.

Server
  Machine or service that is used as a hosting of the published material, or as
  a computer that serves computations on demand.

Run in the browser
  Quality of an online code that allows the client web browser to run the code
  without the need of an external computational server.  The content of the
  website is still provided by a host as a static page, but any changes in the
  code and computations are done solely in the client.

Notebook
  Document with a consecutive sequence of cells of text and code that can be
  executed linearly. The text is usually _markdown_ and the code can be of
  different programming languages given that a corresponding kernel is
  available.


Collaborative
  Quality of a tool or platform that allows the edition of files concurrently
  by multiple online users, with the capability of dealing with possible
  eddition conflicts.

Publishing system
  Tool or platform that allows the creation of online content that can be
  displayed in a web browser.

Directives
  Special functions that are defined in a publishing system to render a piece
  of code in the form of text in a predefined manner. Some examples of
  directives already available in Jupyter{book} is the _{note}_ that renders a
  text as an information box.

Role
  Reduced version of directives that usually span less than one line of text.

Authoring tool
  Tool or platform that allows the edition and creation of various input files
  that are necessary for a publishing system to generate the publishable
  outputs. Common input files created with authoring tools are text narratives,
  folder structures, figures, tables, code snipets, and bibliography.

Development environment
  Programming environment that is necessary to use an authoring tool or a
  publication system.


Frame
  In the context of text edition, said to the surrounding characters that
  indicate a special piece of text. For example the use of the dollar signs for
  mathematical notation (`$\Sgima_{i=0}^N i$` is rendered as $\Sigma_{i=0}^N
  i$).

Artefact
  Any form of input that is used to generate the content presented to the final
  user. Some common artifacts are figures, tables, code snippets or mathematical
  typesetting.

Composition toolkit
  A set of tools that can automatically aggregate a pool of artefacts and compose
  them in a series of output formats (e.g. paper, presentation slides, poster,
  computational notebook). Publishing systems may use composition toolkits.

MyST Markdown
  Extended markdown syntax that supports basic academic publishing features like
  tables, figures, mathematical typesetting and bibliography management.

Publication Workflow
  Full publication process from the authoring process (generation of the input
  artefacts) to the end result of a publication output.

Editing environment
  Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that allows the edition of content.
