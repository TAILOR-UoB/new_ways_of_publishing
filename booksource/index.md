# New Ways of Publishing: A Roadmap to Authoring Online Training Material

[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](assets/documents/nwop_book.pdf)

This website provides a set of guidelines to publish online training material
using state-of-the-art web authoring tools, and also serves as an example authored 
using the `JupyterBook` framework for producing documents from computational content.
It has been prepared as a deliverable of the 
[TAILOR Network of Trustworthy AI through Integrating Learning, Optimisation and Reasoning](https://tailor-network.eu) 
as part of Work Package 9: Network Collaboration, 
and is made freely available to the academic community. 

These new authoring and formatting tools give rise to **new ways of working and publishing**. 
For example, `Jupyter Notebooks`[^jupyter] can be used in teaching, for self-study, as lab notebooks, for research collaborations, and in a host of other ways. 
But there are many other recent developments that open further avenues for authoring and publishing dynamic and interactive training material. 
Knowing about these developments and opportunities helps academic writers to publish their training material in the best possible forms. 

[^jupyter]:  `JupyterBook` and `Jupyter Notebook` are related but different, see {ref}`sec:com:nar`.

This **roadmap** therefore has twin objectives: 
- to chart the ever-growing landscape of publishing workflows, formatting tools and authoring tools; 
- to provide some itineraries through this landscape, such as converting an existing $\LaTeX$ Beamer presentation to `Quarto`. 

The companion website https://tailor-uob.github.io/mooc_trustworthy_ai/ shows the rendered results. 
The content can be viewed in a variety of ways, following the [](sec:SIMO) paradigm. 

:::{admonition} Who should read this
We prepared this material for an audience with experience in authoring AI-related training material using well-established tools such as $\LaTeX$, Overleaf, Google Docs etc. You will learn about the latest tools and frameworks such as JupyterBook (not be confused with Jupyter Notebooks) and Quarto. These tools make it easier to deliver content in a variety of ways, and also offer the opportunity to add interactive elements. We give examples of possible workflows to get you started.

:::{admonition} How to read this
:class: tip
The structure of the document is fairly self-explanatory. 
In {ref}`sec:intro` we provide context and introduce terminology
(if you're in a hurry, skip to {ref}`sec:formatting-tools` which describes the most recent developments). 
The {ref}`sec:exa` section gives many examples of static, dynamic and interactive content. 
We then give {ref}`sec:use`: concrete use cases of authoring training material using `Quarto`,
either from scratch or converting content originally authored in $\LaTeX$ Beamer. 

The full table of contents is given in the panel on the left, each element of which is a separate webpage. 
You can step through these pages in order by following the `Next` link at the bottom of each page. 
If the page has an internal heading structure this is indicated in a panel on the top-right.
