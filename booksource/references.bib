 abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

However, the current methodology of machine learning research and consequently, implementations of the real-world applications of such algorithms, seems to have a recurring HARKing (Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) issue. In this work, we elaborate on the algorithmic, economic and social reasons and consequences of this phenomenon. We present examples from current common practices of conducting machine learning research (e.g. avoidance of reporting negative results) and failure of generalization ability of the proposed algorithms and datasets in actual real-life usage. Furthermore, a potential future trajectory of machine learning research and development from the perspective of accountable, unbiased, ethical and privacy-aware algorithmic decision making is discussed. We would like to emphasize that with this discussion we neither claim to provide an exhaustive argumentation nor blame any specific institution or individual on the raised issues. This is simply a discussion put forth by us, insiders of the machine learning field, reflecting on us.},

 abstract = {The machine learning publication process is broken, of that there can be no doubt. Many of these flaws are attributed to the current workflow: LaTeX to PDF to reviewers to camera ready PDF. This has understandably resulted in the desire for new forms of publications; ones that can increase inclusively, accessibility and pedagogical strength. However, this venture fails to address the origins of these inadequacies in the contemporary paper workflow. The paper, being the basic unit of academic research, is merely how problems in the publication and research ecosystem manifest; but is not itself responsible for them. Not only will simply replacing or augmenting papers with different formats not fix existing problems; when used as a band-aid without systemic changes, will likely exacerbate the existing inequities. In this work, we argue that the root cause of hindrances in the accessibility of machine learning research lies not in the paper workflow but within the misaligned incentives behind the publishing and research processes. We discuss these problems and argue that the paper is the optimal workflow. We also highlight some potential solutions for the incentivization problems.},

 abstract = {Papers are hard to write. Survey papers are just that much harder. From the authors' perspective, challenges include the responsibility to not erase out important work being done by (sometimes) adversarially aligned research groups, finding the right semantic clustering to sub-categorize individual contributions, controlling for the verbosity and length of the final paper, ensuring an optimal mixing of personal opinion and the innate narratives in the paper(s) being cited, version controlling, ease of updating, and also the aesthetics of presentation. From the reader's viewpoint, challenges include ease of reading, single-snapshot summarizability, portability, and being given the agency to edit or fork their own copies. Taking cues from the emergence of the cheat-sheet culture in machine learning and the virtues of living editable documentation and version control, we propose an interactive and live SVG format based methodology that we term SPICE: Survey Papers as Interactive Cheat-sheet Embedding. We cover the technical details behind constructing SPICEs and present an example gallery covering `hot button' areas in machine learning such as Out of distribution detection, the `All you need' histrionics and Transformer architectures.

 abstract = {Science is a debate. Debates happen where there is wiggle room for interpretation. There is no debate when all parties agree, or when all parties know why they disagree. Scientific debates can be settled by agreeing on an experimental protocol. Good protocols identify wiggle room and preemptively get rid of it, by fixing the interpretation of experimental results before the experiment proceeds. “Are doctors transmitting deadly illnesses from cadavers to birthing mothers? Have some doctors wash their hands after autopsies. Let us agree that if their patients have better survival rates than usual, it means that infections travel on the hands of doctors (Carter 1985).” Experimental results might tell you which way the settlement goes, but ideally the debate itself ends with the protocol. From this point of view, Science is the art of defining convincing protocols: scientific papers are more interesting and more rigorous when they are written by two people who start out genuinely disagreeing. Mimosa is an attempt at harnessing both support and disagreement in science into a productive, collaborative format. Mimosa also tries to address many of the numerous recognised issues within the current format for sharing science, born at a different time and for the wrong reasons. When it first started, Wikipedia was greeted with suspicion. It is now a major platform for finding information, used by all demographics. Wikipedia has a famous rule: “No original research.” Mimosa aspires to be that free, open-collaborative online platform created and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors, dedicated to original research.},

This paper describes how the vector space model from information retrieval, more normally associated with full text search, has been employed in the open source SubSift software to support workflows to profile and compare such collections of documents. SubSift was originally designed to match submitted conference or journal papers to potential peer reviewers based on the similarity between the paper’s abstract and the reviewer’s publications as found in online bibliographic databases such as Google Scholar. The software is implemented as a family of RESTful web services that, composed into a re-useable workflow, have already been used to support several major data mining conferences. Alternative workflows and service compositions are now enabling other interesting applications, such as expert finding for the press and media, organisational profiling, and suggesting potential interdisciplinary research partners. This work is a useful generalisation and proof-of-concept realisation of an engineering solution to enable RESTful services to be assembled in workflows to analyse general content in a way that is not immediately available elsewhere. The challenges and lessons learned in the implementation and use of SubSift are discussed.},

            A formal model of the scientific communication process is presented using the IDEF0 notation. The model provides a roadmap for policy discussions and further research. In comparison to earlier models it is more detailed and hierarchical, and includes more modelling constructs. It includes the whole communication value chain, from initial research to the assimilation of research results to everyday practice. Although the model treats both informal and formal communication, as well as the publishing of data, its focus is on modelling the publishing and indexing of traditional peer‐reviewed journal articles, and finding and retrieving them. New developments enabled by the Internet, such as open access journals and e‐print repositories, are also included.},
