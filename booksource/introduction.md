## Brief introduction of the topic

New ways of publishing provides a guide on how to elaborate teaching and
learning material in the 21st century.

## Why is the topic important

We are still using ancient techniques for printing teaching material in books
and other physical documents. Woodblock printing was used in China before
220 A.D. while Movble-type printing in China about 1040. In Europe the printing
press was invented around 1450 and rotary printing press in 1843.

Printing capacity impressions per hour: in 1600, 200

| year | 1600 | 1800 | 1812 | 1813 | 1814 | 1818 |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Impressions per hour | 200 | 480 | 800 | 1,100 | 2,000 | 2,400 |

Teaching material progression:

- Word to word (spoken, human interaction)
- Hands on (spoken, physical, interactive)
- The press (China 1040, Europe 1450s)
- Books (read, non-interactive)
- Projectors (1870s)
- Lectures with word to word + books (spoken, read, human interaction)
- Lectures with word to word + hands on (spoken, read, physical, interactive)
- Filmstrip projector (1925)
- Lectures by School teachers and military offices with projectors
- The analog video (1950s)
- Video recordings (visual, non-interactive)
- The digital video (1970s)
- Dynamic slides (visual, non-interactive)
- Lectures with slides (spoken, read, visual, human interaction)
- The Internet (1960s)
- Gamification (visual, computer interaction)

## Explanation of the contribution of the findings and key message

Points to mention:

- Most of the teaching and learning material is still static content in the
  form of books, slides and text documents.
- There are new tools that allow the seamless integration of static and dynamic
  content with mild technological requirements.
- Papers and articles are still submitted as static documents in Word docs,
  LaTeX files or PDFs.
- Papers run over multiple iterations that could be version controlled for
  transparency.
- There is an increasing interest on appendices to incorporate other type of
  content, or links to software or datasets to provide transparency and
  reproducibility of results.
