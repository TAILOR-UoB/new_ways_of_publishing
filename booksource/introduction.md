# Introduction


Points to mention:

- Most of the teaching and learning material is still static content in the
  form of books, slides and text documents.
- There are new tools that allow the seamless integration of static and dynamic
  content with mild requirements.
- Papers and articles are still submitted as static documents in Word docs,
  LaTeX files or PDFs.
- There is an increasing interest on appendices to incorporate other type of
  content, or links to software or datasets to provide transparency and
  reproducibility of results.
