# A brief history of teaching methodologies


Most teachers and academics are still using ancient techniques for printing
teaching material in books and other physical documents. Woodblock printing was
used in China before 220 A.D. while Movble-type printing in China about 1040.
In Europe the printing press was invented around 1450 and rotary printing press
in 1843.

Printing capacity impressions per hour: in 1600, 200

## MOOCs

In the inflated expectation stage of Garner's hype cycle in 2012 with 100,000
students {cite}`haber2014moocs`

Commonly low completing rates (15%), lack of personalisation, less academic and
more industrialised as a product. Sometimes courses are free.
