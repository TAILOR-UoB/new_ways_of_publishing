# Publishing workflow

The `publishing workflow` is the full process in which authors produce results
and the correspoinding input artefacts that will be necessary to make a
publication, and the `publication system` that is involved to compile all the
material into the final publication. 

In this `Roadmap` we want to emphasize the difference between the `authoring`
and the `publishing` parts of the full `publication workflow`. The `authoring`
consists on creating a structured composition of input artefacts that are
necessary to generate the objective publication. The authoring may also
be able to generate an output, but this one may differ slightly on the final
output generated by the publication system. The differences may have a
technical origin, or the editors may need to do some changes for the final
publication.

    A1{{"Authoring tool"}} --> I1("Figures + Code + \n Tables + ..."):::input
    I1 -.-> A2{{"Authoring tool"}}
    A2 -.-> O2["Output preview"]:::preview
    I1 --> P1{{"Publishing System"}}
    P1 --> O1["Output"]:::output
    classDef input fill:#ffa;
    classDef output fill:#faa;
    classDef preview fill:#fca;
```

 The process of creating the input artefacts is commonly distributed,
 non-linear and may generate redundant information. Keeping all the versions of
 the artefacts updated may be a challenge, as parts of the artefacts are
 re-used and adapted to be used within the authoring tools.

```{mermaid}

    I1("Source code"):::input -.->|Part of the code| MS
    I1 & I3{{"Analysis"}} --> M1("Results"):::input
    M1 --> I3
    I3 --> M2("Figures + Tables + \n ..."):::input
    I4["Other sources"]:::external --> M2
    M1 -.->|Part of the results| MS("Figures + Code + \n Tables + ..."):::input
    M2 -.->|Subset| MS
    classDef input fill:#ffa;
    classDef external fill:#aaa,stroke:#333,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
```
