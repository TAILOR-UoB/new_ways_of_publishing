# Authoring tools

`Authoring tools` are tools that help the creation of authoring artefacts which
will be compiled by a `publishing systems` to generate outputs. For example, a
text editor to create `LaTeX` is an authoring tool, while `pdflatex`,
`XeLaTeX`, `LuaTeX` are publishing systems that compile all the input artefacts
to pdf.

## Text editors

- Overleaf self-defined as a collaborative authoring tool, defined by
  University of Manchester as a writing and publishing tool.
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- RStudio
- [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
- Typst provides an writing environment for markdown style files that are
  rendered in the web browser. It allows collaboration and real-time multi-user
  edition.

## Real time collaboration

Visual Studio Live Share
Overleaf
Google Docs

## Interactive code

- [Jupyter Widgets](https://jupyter.org/widgets): 
- [htmlwidgets for R](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/):
- [Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observable-javascript): Tool to
run Javascript code dynamically that supports D3, Lodash and Apache Arrow.
- [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/): Run Python or R code in the browser.
Check the [Python example documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/overview.html).
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) is a port of Python and other packages compiled to
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). Some examples of supported
packages are  regex, pyyaml, lxml and scientific Python packages including
numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
WebAssembly is a binary format for compiled programs.
