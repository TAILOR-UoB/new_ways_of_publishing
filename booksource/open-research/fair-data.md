# FAIR data

The FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) principles of sharing
data were defined by a consortium of scientists and organisations and published
in the journal Scientific Data {cite}`Wilkinson2016-so`. 

- **Findable**: Additional metadata is added in order to easily identify and
  find the data with a search engine. The metadata needs to contain clear
  information and the data requires a unique identifier.
- **Accessible**: There is a specific protocol that can be followed to retrieve
  the metadata of the data of interest (even if the data is not available). The
  metadata is also understandable by humans and can be processed by machines.
  The data is stored in a trusted repository that ensures its accessibility for
  a particular period of time.
- **Interoperable**: The metadata follows a formal structure that is commonly
  accepted by multiple parties. Ideally the metadata has a vocabulary that
  follows the FAIR principles and can form a knowledge representation.
- **Reusable**: It is clearly specified how the data can be reused by others,
  including a license and any usage limitations.
