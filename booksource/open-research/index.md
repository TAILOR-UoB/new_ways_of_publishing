# Open Research

Open Research is 

- Open Access of publications (Green, Gold, Hybrid, Diamond)
- FAIR Data (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable)
- Open Code (Open source licenses)
- Research Profile (e.g. ORCID)

New ways of publishing potentially needs to consider all of the aforementioned
points as the research is published online, the code can be open, if data is
used it needs to adhere to certain practices and the authors of the publication
may benefit from a research profile.

Open research has multiple benefits as the work gets wider visibility,
promoting new collaborations.

The university, funders and publishers may have specific polices that are
enforced in your publications.

Major funders require information about a research data at application stage,
and a 'Data Management Plan' (See [Writing a data management
plan](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/writing-a-data-management-plan/)).
Usually covers

- What type of data will be generated
- How the data will be organised (e.g. naming conventions, version control,
  ...)
- How will the data be stored and for how long it will be maintained.
- What data will **not** be shared, or any period of exclusive use.
