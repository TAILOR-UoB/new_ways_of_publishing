# Open Access

Open Access is a broad international movement that specifies a set of principle
to make research free of access and online, defined as "digital, online, free
of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.". One of the
main objectives is to publish research work under the CC-BY license.

There are multiple types of Open Access models that are used by journals.
However, the most common ones are gold, green and hybrid OA journals, while
some journals are hybrid. In all the cases the article is free to read but they
have the following differences.

**Gold OA**: The article is free to read, but the authors need to pay the
publisher, requiring an external funding. The 'Article Processing Charge' costs
an average of £2,000 and can reach £10,000.


**Green OA**: The author accepted manuscript can be hosted in some repository
(e.g. Pure is a repository of scholarly works for the Universtiy of Bristol).
The publisher retains the final version in their website. The article has a
CC-BY license and there is no embargo on its use. Additional considerations may
be required by the authors, for example the inclusion of a statement in the
publishers submission, like in the case of the University of Bristol
recomendation:

  "For the purpose of open access, the author(s) has applied a Creative Commons
  Attribution (CC BY) licence to any Author Accepted Manuscript version arising
  from this submission."


**Diamond OA**: These are crowd-funded by libraries and scholarly organisations
that pay for the processing charges. Then in the same manner as the **Green
OA**, the accepted manuscript can be hosted in a repository, while the final
copy is available in the publisher's website.

Most of the journals that accept OA can be found in the website
