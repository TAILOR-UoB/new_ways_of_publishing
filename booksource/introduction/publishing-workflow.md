# Publishing workflow

The `publishing workflow` is the full process in which authors produce results
and the correspoinding input artefacts that will be necessary to make a
publication, and the `publication system` that is involved to compile all the
material into the final publication. 

In this `Roadmap` we want to emphasize the difference between the `authoring`
and the `formatting` parts of the full `publication workflow`. The `authoring`
consists on creating a structured composition of input artefacts that are
necessary to generate the objective publication. The authoring may also
be able to generate an output, but this one may differ slightly on the final
output generated by the publication system. The differences may have a
technical origin, or the editors may need to do some changes for the final
publication.

 The process of creating the input artefacts is commonly distributed,
 non-linear and may generate redundant information. Keeping all the versions of
 the artefacts updated may be a challenge, as parts of the artefacts are
 re-used and adapted to be used within the authoring tools.

### Formatting tools

Formatting tools format the input files into publishing outputs outputs (e.g.
html, slides, posters, and pdfs) from a set of input artefacts (e.g. plain
text, markdown, LaTeX, tables, figures). In this Section we divide the tools
into three paradigms *Single-In-Single-Out (SISO)*, *Single-In-Multi-Out
(SIMO)* and *Multiple-In-Multiple-Out (MIMO)*. In this roadmap we only focus on
the second type, as it is covers the most adopted and flexible systems for
authoring training material.

## Single-In-Single-Out

_Formatting tools_ have usually specialised in generating only one type of
output provided one or more types of input files. This is one of the most
common approaches when producing an article. The text, figures, tables and
other artefacts are assembled with some authoring tool and compiled with a
specialised formatting tool to produce a printable pdf. Once it has been
accepted a presentation may require parts of the original artefacts and a
different _formatting tools_. It is then common to have a duplicate of the same
content with mild modifications in a separate environment. The same process is
often repeated if a poster, computational notebooks, or a website need to be
created. We refer to this paradigm of publishing system as Single-In-Single-Out
as each system works independently, while the authors need to keep up to date
copies of similar content in each of them.

    I2("Text + Figures + \n Code + ... v.2"):::input --> P2{{"Formatting tool 2"}}
    I3("Text + Figures + \n Code + ... v.3"):::input --> P3{{"Formatting tool 3"}}

    style O4 fill:#bfb
    classDef input fill:#ffa;
    classDef empty fill:#aaa,stroke:#333,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;
```

Common examples of this type of paradigm is the authoring and publishing
workflows followed by creating documents with Microsoft Word[^word], Libre
Office Writer[^writer], LaTeX[^latex]; sets of slides with Microsoft
PowerPoint[^powpoint], LibreOffice Impress[^impress], LaTeX Beamer[^beamer],
Reveal.js[^reveal], or Google Slides; posters with Microsoft Publisher, Google
Slides, LaTeX, etc.

## Single-In-Multiple-Out

More modern publishing systems allow the generation of multiple types of
publication formats from a joint set of input artefacts. We refer to this
paradigm as Single-In-Multiple-Out (SIMO). This paradigm offers multiple
benefits, among them: (1) keep all the artefacts in a unique
location facilitates finding the required documents, (2) keeping a unique
source of history changes and versions which is useful for auditing and
transparency, (3) not duplicating artefacts that are not changed between
different publishing systems.

```{mermaid}
%%{ init : { "flowchart" : { "curve" : "stepBefore" }}}%%

flowchart LR
    I1("Text + Figures + \n Code + ..."):::input --- dummy2{{"Formatting tool"}}
    dummy2 --> O1["Published \n Paper \n (PDF)"]
    dummy2 --> O2["Presentation \n Slides \n (PPTX/PDF)"]
    dummy2 --> O3["Poster \n (PPTX/PDF)"]
    dummy2 --> O4["Computational \n Notebook \n (Colab)"]
    classDef input fill:#ffa;
    style O1 fill:#fca
    style O2 fill:#bff
    style O3 fill:#f99
    style O4 fill:#bfb
```

Nowadays, this type of publishing systems are getting more common being able to
produce multiple types of outputs from the same sources. In this roadmap we
focus on the state-of-the-art publishing systems that fall into this category.
The same roadmap is an example of one of such systems (Jupyter Book), while the
rest of the document and use cases also include Quarto. The following
subsections describe what are the main characteristics of the most adopted
ones.

### Jupyter Book

Jupyter Book[^jbook] is one of the main projects of the Executable Books
Project[^ebookp], together with the other project MyST Markdown[^myst]. The
Executable Books Project is an international collaboration to build open source
tools for publishing computational documents based on the Jupyter
ecosystem[^jupyter]. Jupyter Book can read markdown, MyST Markdown, Jupyter
notebooks and
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)[^rst]. It is based
on the [Sphinx documentation engine](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
being able to produce html websites, pdf, and computational narratives. It
supports multiple programming languages in the Jupyter notebooks provided that
a Jupyter kernel exist (e.g. Python, Julia, Rubi, Haskell, and many other
languages[^kernels]).
Websites that include computational narratives can also bennefit from live
environments thanks to the integration of Binder, Thebe and Google
Colab[^colab]. It supports multiple types of narrative content like highlighted
notes, code cells, quotations, epigraphs, glossaries, index of terms,
footnotes, references, grids, cards, dropdown menus, tab content, maths,
equations, proofs, theorems, algorithms, and more. The Jupyter Book system has
been used in multiple ocasions to publish online material, an extensive gallery
can be found at https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/gallery/. This website
has been created with Jupyter Book and serves as an example of some of its
functionalities.

### Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is another open-source publishing system with the
objective of facilitating the collaboration to create scientific content.
Quarto is sponsored by Posit[^posit], and follows the development of the R Markdown
publishing system extending the focus from the programming language R to
Python, R, Julia and Observable. It supports Jupyter notebooks, markdown and
their own extension Quarto markdown. The conversion to different output formats
is done with pandoc[^pandoc], which is able to produce presentations (Reveal.js),
dashboards, websites, blogs, books, PDFs, Microsoft Word, ePub and more. Quarto
is integrated into multiple authoring environments like Microsoft Visual
Studio, Jupyter Lab, Rstudio[^rstudio], and Atlassian Confluence[^confluence]
among others.

### R markdown

[R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a flavoured markdown type with
special focus on the R programming language and a publishing system. The
publishing system uses R markdown files (with extension `.rmd`) or standard
markdown and can produce various output formats including HTML, PDFs, Microsoft
Word documents, Beamer presentations, HTML5 slides, scientific articles and
books (with the the help of the bookdown R package[^bookdown]). It also support
other programming languages including Python, SQL and others with a language
engine[^engines]. R markdown is also integrated in Rstudio[^rstudio].

%- [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/):
%  - Input R markdown files (.rmd)

### D2L book

D2L book is a Python package and a toolkit to build online and printed books.
The package was mainly developed for the publication of the book [Dive into
Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/){cite}`zhang2023dive`, which had multiple
collaborators mostly from Amazon. It is mainly focused for content that
includes computational narratives in Python. The input files are mainly MyST
markdown and Jupyter Notebooks. The publishing part is made with pandoc and
Sphinx allowing the creation of websites and pdf documents.

### Sphinx

Sphinx[^sphinx] is an open-source documentation engine that is based on
Docutils[^docutils]; extending it to multi-page documentation. Docutils is an
open-source text processing system that uses the plain text easy-to-read
reStructuredText to create documentation in multiple formats, such as HTML,
LaTeX, Linux man pages[^man], OpenDocument[^odf], or XML[^xml]. Sphinx supports
reStructuredText and MyST markdown as input files and can generate multiple
output formats including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, ePub, and Texinfo[^texinfo] (the
official documentation format of the GNU project[^gnu]).
