# Introduction

**Header titles to be removed**

## Brief introduction of the topic

New ways of publishing provides a guide on how to elaborate teaching and
learning material in the 21st century that can be delivered in various formats
like static documents, dynamic presentations, videos or online material.

## Why is the topic important

We are still using ancient techniques for printing teaching material in books
and other physical documents. Woodblock printing was used in China before
220 A.D. while Movble-type printing in China about 1040. In Europe the printing
press was invented around 1450 and rotary printing press in 1843.

## What is the gap that this document wants to fill

There is no standard method to create teaching material, which makes it
difficult to create long-term tools around them.
This may be beneficial from an exploratory perspective as new teaching methods
have emerged by adapting new tools to the teaching environment.
However, some times the teaching material is kept technologically outdated
because of the lack of time of exploring new avenues and ignoring the available
tools to facilitate the transformation.
This guide provides a helping hand to understand all the tools that are
available, and properly plan the time necessary to modernize old teaching
material.

## What are the questions answered and the aim of this document

The document can be used to search available technologies and tools to publish
your material in different forms.
It also provides guides and examples on how to use those technologies.
Finally, it contains some of the most common successful use cases to adapt
previous material into a more modern form.

## Indication of method and approach followed

The number of tools available for online authoring is growing very fast.
This means that specific tools may be outdated in a matter of months.
Because of that, we tried to list all the available publishing tools that have
been well established for a minimum of time (**time to be determined**).
Furthermore, the examples are provided in the form of external links to guides
an tutorials in the majority of the cases.
While in some of the most well established methods we may include guides,
examples and use cases in this same website.

## Key message

## Summary of findings

## Explanation of the contribution of the findings and key message

Points to mention:

- Most of the teaching and learning material is still static content in the
  form of books, slides and text documents.
- There are new tools that allow the seamless integration of static and dynamic
  content with mild technological requirements.
- Papers and articles are still submitted as static documents in Word docs,
  LaTeX files or PDFs.
- Papers run over multiple iterations that could be version controlled for
  transparency.
- There is an increasing interest on appendices to incorporate other type of
  content, or links to software or datasets to provide transparency and
  reproducibility of results.
