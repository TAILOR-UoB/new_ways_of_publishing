# Introduction

The landscape of tools for authoring and publishing training material is vast, 
and creating new or upgrading legacy material may appear daunting with all the available options.
This roadmap surveys the landscape and provides actionable guidelines 
for publishing modern online training materials with state-of-the-art tools. 
We focus on {ref}`sec:pub` that
use standard authoring artefacts (such as plain text, tables and figures) that
can generate multiple publishing outputs (like slides, websites, pdfs, or
documents).

The proliferation and adoption of the World Wide Web has allowed the modernisation of teaching
material that is cross-platform and dynamic. Clear examples of modern teaching
material online include video recordings (e.g. Khan Academy), online exams 
(e.g. Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs), personal blogs with dynamic
illustrations, and sets of animated presentations. However, large parts of the 
currently available teaching material still focus on printable formats, 
with the possible addition of hyperlinks for online delivery. 

The lack of standards for publishing hinders the adoption of one authoring file
format and increases the efforts to improve individual publishing workflows.
Furthermore, the time spent getting familiar with one technology may not be
productive in future with the rapidly changing publishing environment.
Additionally, multiple publishing outputs require different input formats which
forces the duplication of efforts to produce very similar material (e.g.
printed pdf, website, blog post, slides, posters). 

This roadmap provides an introduction to modern {sec}`sec:aut` and {sec}`sec:formatting-tools`. 
We explore the most broadly adopted authoring and publishing platforms, 
as well as online collaboration tools to facilitate the creation of shared online
material.  We pay special attention to the possible standardisation of a
workflow to minimise the effort of authoring artefacts while maximizing the
range of output modalities. Two such publishing systems are
Jupyter Book and Quarto for which multiple examples are provided.

We also provide some use-case examples of a full workflow to generate online
training material (including this same website). All the material is kept in a
version control environment (GitHub) to maximise transparency and
reproducibility while allowing the automatic generation of the output artefacts
with GitHub Actions. The input artefact is constructed in such a way that
multiple types of output formats can be generated automatically from them (e.g.
formats like an HTML website, Reveal.js slides, pdf, and e-book).

## Previous notes:

### Brief introduction of the topic

New ways of publishing provides a guide on how to elaborate teaching and
learning material in the 21st century that can be delivered in various formats
like static documents, dynamic presentations, videos or online material.

### Why is the topic important

We are still using ancient techniques for printing teaching material in books
and other physical documents. Woodblock printing was used in China before
220 A.D. while Movble-type printing in China about 1040. In Europe the printing
press was invented around 1450 and rotary printing press in 1843.

### What is the gap that this document wants to fill

There is no standard method to create teaching material, which makes it
difficult to create long-term tools around them.
This may be beneficial from an exploratory perspective as new teaching methods
have emerged by adapting new tools to the teaching environment.
However, some times the teaching material is kept technologically outdated
because of the lack of time of exploring new avenues and ignoring the available
tools to facilitate the transformation.
This guide provides a helping hand to understand all the tools that are
available, and properly plan the time necessary to modernize old teaching
material.

### What are the questions answered and the aim of this document

The document can be used to search available technologies and tools to publish
your material in different forms.
It also provides guides and examples on how to use those technologies.
Finally, it contains some of the most common successful use cases to adapt
previous material into a more modern form.

### Indication of method and approach followed

The number of tools available for online authoring is growing very fast.
This means that specific tools may be outdated in a matter of months.
Because of that, we tried to list all the available publishing tools that have
been well established for a minimum of time (**time to be determined**).
Furthermore, the examples are provided in the form of external links to guides
an tutorials in the majority of the cases.
While in some of the most well established methods we may include guides,
examples and use cases in this same website.

### Key message

### Summary of findings

### Explanation of the contribution of the findings and key message

Points to mention:

- Most of the teaching and learning material is still static content in the
  form of books, slides and text documents.
- There are new tools that allow the seamless integration of static and dynamic
  content with mild technological requirements.
- Papers and articles are still submitted as static documents in Word docs,
  LaTeX files or PDFs.
- Papers run over multiple iterations that could be version controlled for
  transparency.
- There is an increasing interest on appendices to incorporate other type of
  content, or links to software or datasets to provide transparency and
  reproducibility of results.
