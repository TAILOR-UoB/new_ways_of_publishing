# Open Profile

The authoring of any material should clearly and uniquely identify the identity
of the contributors. In printing material it was common to use the name and
surnames of the authors as an identification. However, in multiple occasions
this is not enough for disambiguation. With more recent online tools it is
possible to disambiguate authors by providing additional information and
creating unique identifiers for each of them. Webpages like ORCID[^ORCID]
(Open Researcher and Contributor ID) provide unique identifiers for researchers
and connect them with their contributions. Other identifiers are
the Scopus Author Profile[^scopus] by Elsevier, ResearcherID[^clarivate] from
Clarivate, the Digital Author Identifier (DAI)[^DAI] by the Dutch research
system, among others.
