# FAIR data

The FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) principles of sharing
data were defined by a consortium of scientists and organisations, and
published in the journal Scientific Data {cite}`Wilkinson2016-so`. The four
principles that shape the acronym are:

- **Findable**: Additional metadata is added in order to easily identify and
  find the data with a search engine. The metadata needs to contain clear
  information and the data requires a unique identifier.
- **Accessible**: There is a specific protocol that can be followed to retrieve
  the metadata of the data of interest (even if the data is not available). The
  metadata is also understandable by humans and can be processed by machines.
  The data is stored in a trusted repository that ensures its accessibility for
  a particular period of time.
- **Interoperable**: The metadata follows a formal structure that is commonly
  accepted by multiple parties. Ideally the metadata has a vocabulary that
  follows the FAIR principles and can form a knowledge representation.
- **Reusable**: It is clearly specified how the data can be reused by others,
  including a license and any usage limitations.

## Data format and storage

- Make machine readible and accessible
- Use open file formats.
- File formats that do not require a propertary application to be opened.
- File formats that store plain information
- Metadata human readible and computer readible
- Provide good documentation (e.g. README plain text file)
- Trusted data repository for long term storage

Examples of data repositories
- figshare https://figshare.com/ allows to upload any file format and assigns a
  DOI identifier for citations.
- Mendeley Data https://data.mendeley.com/ allows the storage of public or
  private data, keeps versioning and ensures long-term storage by Data
  Archiving & Networked Services[^DANS].
- Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository https://zenodo.org/ it
  facilitates making the repository private and can automatically make it open
  once an associated paper is published. No restrictions on the file type and
  datasets up to 50 GB.
- The Open Science Framework[^OSF] is an open-source research management and
  collaboration tool to facilitate the documentation of a full project
  lifecycle.

## Data Licenses

Why a license

- Business organisations and start-ups can not use it
- Provide certainty on its use cases
- The simpler the better for reuse
- It is not enough making data publicly available, it requires a license to
  provide legal clarity on its potential use.
- Open data should be licenses in order to be publicly available, usable and
sharable.
- Without license, User do not have permission to access, use and share under copyright and
  database laws.

Publishing a dataset online does not entitle the ways in which the data can be
used. When the data is generated it is automatically protected by copyright and
without a license, users do not have permission to access, use and share under
copyright and database laws. For example, in 2015, ~54% of the open data in
open data catalogues across the European Union was not truly open as it was not
licensed[^1].

There are multiple licenses to choose from, and as legal documents they may
differ in some small details. In order to facilitate the understanding of the
licenses and maximise the use of your material it is advisable to use well
known licenses. 

Some of the most common licenses are the Creative Commons. Similar principles
shown previously in the open source licenses section apply here. For example
the **Open Data Commons by Attribution License (ODC-BY v4.0**) allows to copy,
distribute and use a database, produce new works derived from it, modify,
transform and build upon it subject to attribution to the original work. A
similar license that forces any derived work to be shared under the same
license is the **Creative Commons by Attribution share-alike (CC-BY-SA v4.0)**.
On the other hand, a less restrictive license for public domain is the **CC0**
which does not require attribution.

The licenses can also be created to fit particular purposes, or to facilitate
its adoption in certain organisations. This is the case for some governments may
create their own open data licenses to facilitate its adoption among
governmental organisations. Some examples of governmental licenses are the UK
Open Government License[^uk], the French Government open License[^fr] and the
Singapore Open Data Licence[^sg].
