# Open Courses

The idea of Open Courses is to take some of the principles of Open Research and
adapt to the creation of teaching material. Open Research is a set of
principles to promote sharing research outcomes in a way that makes research
reproducible and more transparent. There are at least four aspects that need to
be considered:

- **Open Access** of publications (Green, Gold, Hybrid, Diamond)
- **FAIR Data** (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable)
- **Open Code** (Open source licenses)
- **Research Profile** (e.g. ORCID)

New ways of publishing potentially needs to consider all of the aforementioned
points as the intention is to publish teaching material online. The source code
of the course should be open and any data used in the course should adhere to
certain good practices. The authors of the course may also benefit from an open
research profile which would give credibility to the content, transparency and
increase the visibility of other content created by the authors.

Open research has multiple benefits as the work gets wider visibility,
promoting new collaborations.

The university, funders and publishers may have specific polices that are
enforced in your publications.

Major funders require information about a research data at application stage,
and a 'Data Management Plan' (See [Writing a data management
plan](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/staff/researchers/data/writing-a-data-management-plan/)).
Usually covers

- What type of data will be generated
- How the data will be organised (e.g. naming conventions, version control,
  ...)
- How will the data be stored and for how long it will be maintained.
- What data will **not** be shared, or any period of exclusive use.
