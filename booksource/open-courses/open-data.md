# Open Data

- It is not enough making data publicly available, it requires a license to
  provide legal clarity on its potential use.
- Open data should be licenses in order to be publicly available, usable and
sharable.

- Make machine readible and accessible

Why a license

- Business organisations and start-ups can not use it
- Provide certainty on its use cases
- The simpler the better for reuse
- Creative commons standard licenses is a good example
- CC0 for public domain, CC-BY v4.0 for attribution and CC-BY-SA v4.0 for
  attribution and share-alike.
- Comapnies, organisations, and governments that use contractors should ensure
  that they include clauses in the contracts to make the data public. For
  example by including conditions in the contract, or retaining the ownership
  of any generated data to publish themselves.

- Without license, User do not have permission to access, use and share under copyright and
  database laws.
- In 2015, ~54% of the open data was not truly open as it was not licensed.
