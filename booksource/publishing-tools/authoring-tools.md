# Authoring tools

Authoring tools are tools that help the creation of authoring artefacts which
will be compiled by a publishing systems to generate outputs. For example, a
text editor to create `LaTeX` is an authoring tool, while `pdflatex`,
`XeLaTeX`, `LuaTeX` are publishing systems that compile all the input artefacts
to pdf.
